# Project Title

Faithful To Felines a nonprofit 501(c) cat shetler, website revamp! www.faithful2felines.com

## Description

CRM - not much coding, not practical for some. However, let us look at it from this angle. **A little backstory**: I have been volunteering at this particular cat shelter for almost 10 years. I have been active in animal welfare since this time as well. Okay, back to the website. Every person in the shelter is a volunteer - and almost every person working on the website has zero coding knowledge. 

As a software developer (even though I am going to be around) wanted to take an approach that is end-user friendly. CRM's can limit you, yes. However, a website is only useful if the people using it everyday know how to work it. Sometimes I think taking this approach is completely and totally okay. There are so many awesome CRM and tools out there! It is time saving and kind of fun (I think).
